. solutions in Linux

1.  **Connection Refused**: Occurs when the server actively rejects a
    connection request.

    - **Cause**: The service might not be running or configured
      properly.

    - **Solution**: Verify the service status and configuration files.

2.  **Connection Timed Out**: Indicates that the connection attempt took
    too long to complete.

    - **Cause**: Firewall settings, network congestion, or unresponsive
      server.

    - **Solution**: Check firewall rules, network configurations, and
      server responsiveness.

3.  **No Route to Host**: Indicates the inability to reach the
    destination host.

    - **Cause**: Incorrect routing table or network misconfiguration.

    - **Solution**: Check routing tables using route or ip route
      commands.

4.  **Host Unreachable**: Similar to "No Route to Host," signifies the
    inability to reach the destination.

    - **Cause**: Network misconfiguration or incorrect IP address.

    - **Solution**: Verify IP configuration and network settings.

5.  **Destination Host Unreachable**: Indicates that the destination
    host is unreachable.

    - **Cause**: Network misconfiguration, incorrect IP address, or
      server down.

    - **Solution**: Check destination host's status and network
      settings.

6.  **Network is Unreachable**: Suggests that the network is
    unreachable.

    - **Cause**: Network interface down or misconfigured.

    - **Solution**: Check network interface status (ifconfig or ip addr)
      and configurations.

7.  **Name or Service not known**: Occurs when the hostname cannot be
